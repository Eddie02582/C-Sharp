Is there any way that i can keep the kryptondatagridview?<br />\n<br />\nI tried editing the source. Inherited the control from kryptondatagridview instead of windows datagridview. Then rebuild the source file. The dll i got is only 87 kb while the Original is 88 kb. A lot of warings about missing xml values. Any idea what i am doing wrong.<br />\n<br />\nAny help is gratefully appreciated!<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
