    "Description": "Hi,\nGreat work with the ADGV! :)\n\nI have used the Entity Framework to generate model class from the database. I use this model as the datasource of my ADGV. The model has correct data types for the columns but ADGV does not detect that and shows me text filters for all columns. \n\nTake for example the \"amount_local_netto\" column in the attached images. It has the type \"System.Decimal\" but it shows the Text filter.\n\nI have noticed one thing though. If I deliberately change its column.ValueType property to typeof(decimal) in Designer.cs when the columns are being added, then it shows me the correct filter.\n\nWhat could be the problem here? Also, for too many distinct values in a column, the drop-down shows after a big lag. Do you have any good idea to make that faster?\n\nThank you and I look forward to your response.",

Set Nullable property of _amount_local_netto_ to False in the table model\r\n\r\nDid not work. I also tried adding a check for \"this.DataType == typeof(Nullable)\" in the ADGV source, then rebuilt the DLL and added it to my project again which also did not work. \r\n\r\nIs there anything that you might need from me?\r\n\r\nBest.",
