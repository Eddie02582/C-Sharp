    "Description": "hi im using the control and doing my test runs i can see the control is very slow when it comes to big quatity of rows in the table like over 10000 and i have bout 90000 rows and the filters take good time like 5 min some times more before it shows. \r\n\r\nit would be very nice if the loading of the filters and data could be optimized to load data of greate quatity faster.\r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n",
