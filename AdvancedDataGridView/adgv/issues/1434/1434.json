    "Description": "For instance I had to do this to remove the fromBeginButton and put the searchButton and separator before the other 2 buttons.\n```\n      var toolStripItemFromBeginButton = searchToolBar.Items[\"fromBeginButton\"] as ToolStripButton;\n      if (toolStripItemFromBeginButton != null)\n      {\n        toolStripItemFromBeginButton.Checked = false;\n        searchToolBar.Items.Remove(toolStripItemFromBeginButton);\n      }\n      MoveLastItem(3);\n      MoveLastItem(2);\n\n    private void MoveLastItem(int offset)\n    {\n      var toolStripItem = searchToolBar.Items[searchToolBar.Items.Count - 1];\n      searchToolBar.Items.Remove(toolStripItem);\n      searchToolBar.Items.Insert(searchToolBar.Items.Count - offset, toolStripItem);\n    }\n```\nI don't think there is anyway to do this in the winforms designer, so maybe all you can do is make the buttons public.",

      "Message": "Hi JezzaT!There are problem in __SearchToolBar_Resize__ method. Its use width of all elements and if you remove any button it will still continue to affect the calculation of the toolbar`s widthI think best way for you to modify source codeOr i can set buttons from private to protected then you can inherit SearchToolBar control and create you own\r\n\r\nalso you can use disigner if merge __SearchToolBar.InitializeComponent()__ source code with InitializeComponent method of any form\r\n\r\n",

      "Message": "I haven't noticed any problems with toolbar`s width with that button removed.I don't think there is any way you can alter the existing ToolStripItems in a Toolstrip descendant via the designer. To allow that you would need to do something like the BindingNavigator does with the AddStandardItems method, i.e. not have the ToolStripItems in the control itself but have them added to the form. Which would be a lot of work for not much benefit, so, as you say, best way for is to modify source code.Anyway I'm happy enough with the hack I've done.",
